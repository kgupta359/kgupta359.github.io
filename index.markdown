Hello and welcome to my Github page! I hope you are having a pleasant day :)

### Research interests
I'm focused on solving challenges in various domains from
earth to space using satellite data and machine learning. Motivated by
the lighting fast advancements in both space technologies and AI, I aim to
harness their immense potential for the benefit of society. 

To this end, I am interested in applications of AI and space intelligence 
for sustainable use of space, debris management and space situational awareness, 
as well as for earth observation, disaster management and tackling climate change.

### Background
I have a masters degree in physics and a bachelors degree in electronics 
engineering, both from BITS Pilani, India. My MSc thesis was completed at UNSW
Canberra Space; this is also where I was first introduced to the countless possibilities 
of using AI in the space domain. 

I have more than 2 years of experience as a data scientist, machine learning engineer 
and software developer, working on solving problems in various domains including space, 
earth observation, horticulture, and predictive maintenance using real data. 
My full CV can be found [here](/assets/Komal_Gupta_CV.pdf).

I love my work, and I am deeply passionate about projects that have a real, 
positive, lasting impact on people's lives. This is my way of giving back to the
world I was born in. When I am not working, I enjoy amateur astronomy 
with my binoculars, manually brewing coffee, reading, and taking care of my plants.
